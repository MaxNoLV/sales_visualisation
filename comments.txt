unit_price is 0 for 1810 records
shipped_quantity is 0 for 1810 records

51 negative values in 'shipped_quantity' 

Need to transform 'invoice_date' and 'order_date' into datetime
data type.

I have 5 rows where 'shipped_quantity' is >0 and 'unit_price' and 'sales_amount'
are 0. It is a mistake. We shipped product with 0 price! 

I have 51 rows where 'shipped_quantity' and 'sales_amount' have negative
values. These are RETURNS!

I have 1815 rows with 'sales_amount' is 0. It's also a mistake.

I have 2146 rows where 'customer_department' is 0. It's amistake or we have a
department 0?

I have 31 rows with 'item_department' is 0. It's also a mistake.

I have 569 rows with 'vendor_number' is 0 and at the same 
time I have 569 rows with 'vendor_name' is '?'. It's a mistake.

I have 106 rows where 'invoice_number' is with different format (letter 'A' or
'Y' added to the invoice number).
